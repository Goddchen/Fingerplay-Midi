Help Localize
--------------------

If you want ot help localize FingerPlay MIDI to your own language, these are the steps:

1. Fork Repository
2. Create new Branch
3. Create folder for your language under client/res/ (values-xx, where xx is the two letter language code. Example for german: "values-de")
4. Create strings.xml in this folder
5. Copy contents of client/res/values/strings.xml into this your file and translate every string that is not marked translatable=false.
6. Create a pull request and I'll accept your translation and credit you in the app.

All these things can be done in the GitHub web interface, you only need a free account. To create a folder, click create file, type folder name followed by '/' and then the file name.

Thanks in advance.
